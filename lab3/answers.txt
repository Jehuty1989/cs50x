sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: The more sorted the list of numbers is the faster this sorting algorithm runs. I can safely assume this algorithm is Bubble Sort because of that fact.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Merge Sort is the fastest sorting algorithm to use that I know of and after running some tests this was the fastest of the three. It is safe to assume
that this algorithm is Merge Sort.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Regardless of how sorted the lists are this algorithm runs for approximately the same length of time. This is because Selection Sort has a best case
run time and worst case run time of n. So it doesn't matter if the numbers are random, reversed or sorted, this algorithm will take the same time to run.
