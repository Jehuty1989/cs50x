Create stairs in Mario style.

That would be some stairs at height 8, the highest they will go.

So I require a user to input a value of 1 to 8.

int x;

Use a do while loop to make sure x is <1 but >8.

Once the height is chosen time to create the stairs.

e.g. height of 1

if (x = 1)
    {
    printf("#");
    }
